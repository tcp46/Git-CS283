Thoughts on the Lab:
The lab went pretty well. I got a little tripped up on questions 4 and 5.
The Lectures on Monday (07/08) and Wednesday (07/10) were really helpful in 
explaining multiple stars on types (char** and what not).

Question 5:
I am really unsure as to if I did this question right. 
From the instructions given I had a hard time pinpointing exactly what I 
should be doing.
The timings work on the C Visualizer, but for some reason a segmentation error
is thrown when I run it in tux using gcc.
